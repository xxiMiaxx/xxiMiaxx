## Hi there 👋


- I’m @xxiMiaxx, an AI and Computer Vision researcher pursuing my Master’s in Computer Vision at Carnegie Mellon University.

- 🔭 My current research interests include:

    1️⃣ Generative Models: visual generation/editing, visual autoregressive models, and visual generation alignment;
    
    2️⃣ Representation Learning: video understanding, visual relation detection (HOI detection/scene graph generation);
    
    3️⃣ AI for Science and Engineering: high-fidelity simulations combining physics, computer graphics, and machine learning to model fluids, soft bodies, and granular materials;
    
    4️⃣ Robotics and Autonomous Systems: path planning, sensor integration, autonomous navigation, and ROS development.

- 📫 For collaborations, you can reach me at: lalsallo@andrew.cmu.edu
